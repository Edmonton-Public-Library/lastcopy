# lastcopy Readme
## 2021-11-22
Turns out last copy is too late. By the time we are down to the last copy, staff may have deleted the holds, and the discard process will happily purge the record, and the title in the process.

A better solution is to be proactive. Collect data on titles that are volnerable because they are in the last stages of their life cycle. 

The acquisitions librarians have identified several metrics, and pinch points they encounter while determining if a title needs intervention.

## Determining risk
A title is at risk if it can be catagorized by any of the following.
- There are zero or one circulatable copies on a title. This is condition *red*, two copies *yellow*.
- Titles, all of whose items have circulations higher than a given threshold. The threshold may vary by item type, but all users agree on what the threshold is for each item type.

## Pinch points in this process
Several problems occur while trying to determine if a title is a risk.
- Series titles are not cataloged consistently.
- Series titles may use 490, and less frequently 830 tags to indicate volumes.
- Titles may have more than one record, one of which is fine, but the other is at risk. These records should be identified to be merged.
